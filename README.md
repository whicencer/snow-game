# 🎄 New Year Snow Game

A small New Year themed 3D game created in **just 2 days** using a **vibe-coding** approach ❄️  
This project is an experiment in speed, creativity, and modern development tools.

---

## ✨ About the Project

The game was built in **vibe coding** mode — focusing on flow, ideas, rapid prototyping,  
and enjoying the process rather than perfect architecture.

**Artificial intelligence** played an active role in development:
- 🤖 **ChatGPT**
- 🤖 **Gemini**

AI was used to assist with:
- game logic and mechanics  
- debugging  
- idea generation and experimentation

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Three.js** — 3D graphics and scene rendering  
- **JavaScript (ES Modules)**  
- **Vite** — build tool and dev server  
- **GitHub Pages** — deployment  

---

## 🎮 Gameplay (Brief)

- first-person character control  
- snowy city with houses and trees  
- snowball throwing and interactive objects  
- cozy New Year atmosphere ❄️🎁  

This project is not meant to be a finished game —  
it’s a **creative prototype and technical experiment**.
